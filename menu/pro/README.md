# Premium Features
> Abstract Layer premium features will cut down your development work significantly. No need to check Github for 3rd-party libraries that handle small repetitive tasks, and there's no need to constantly check Apple's documentation for code samples. This will also bring down your StackOverflow usage to a minimum.

UITextField has gone to the next level, it can finally do some validations out of the box.
All common field validations are available out of the box like email, password, phone number, date, name, and much more. You can set your regex validation rules too.

### Code Snippets

No more visits to StackOverflow or Apple's documentation to copy random code snippets. You can now simply drag and drop those within Xcode. Examples are code snippets for camera, gallery, address book, Bluetooth APIs, alert controller, network requests, block parameters and much more.
