# Loader & Pull to refresh

> Add a loader & pull to refresh functionality by switching on two options

`ALTableView` offers more options out of the box.
Click on your table view and look at the attributes inspector options:

1. To add a loader, just turn the `Loader` option to `ON` and pick a color
2. To add pull to refresh functionality, simply switch that option `ON` as well

Run the project and see the loader before the data is populated. 

After that, scroll up, and see your native `UIRefreshControl` fully functional without having to worry about any implementation.

Impressive, right?!
