# Abstract Layer

> Abstract Layer is a framework that aims to automate major aspects of native app development.  
> Cut your app development time with a fully customizable native framework for Xcode.

## Getting started
Follow the [Getting started](/menu/getting-started/) guide to setup the framework inside your app.

## Features
Core services handled by the framework for you:

* **Networking**: It’s as simple as specifying your URL and parameters in a visual interface. Session management is our concern.
* **Data Binding**
Binding your parsed data to your UI manually is a thing from the past. This is where the magic happens!
* **Caching**
Media files are cached in memory & on disk according to your needs. No more searching for a library to handle that one.
* **Parsing**
One of the most boring repetitive jobs. We’ll handle it and create your models on the fly.
* **Authentication**
OAuth 1.0b, OAuth 2.0, JWT, Basic or Digest authentication. Pick yours and all your network requests will be handled.
* **Security**
All credentials and sensitive data are stored securely on your device. No more room for hackers!
